# music_suggestions

This is an in progress flask app, the finished product 
will be a website that users can recommend songs to each other 
and keep track of songs that they have listened to.

So far the some placeholder jinja templates have been created but are not 
really what the end UI is going to be. The focus primarily has been setting up
the back end of the with python classes representing the data and a postgresql
schema has been created.
